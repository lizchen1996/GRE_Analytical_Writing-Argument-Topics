# GRE_Analytical_Writing-Argument-Topics

## This page contains the Argument topics for the Analytical Writing section of the GREÂ® General Test. When you take the test, you will be presented with one Argument topic from this pool.

## Each Argument topic consists of a passage that presents an argument followed by specific task instructions that tell you how to analyze the argument. The wording of some topics in the test might vary slightly from what is presented here. Also, because there may be multiple versions of some topics with similar or identical wording but with different task instructions, it is very important to read your test topic and its specific task directions carefully and respond to the wording as it appears in the actual test.
